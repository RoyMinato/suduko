# Suduko

Initially when I wanted to make a sudukuo game, I wasn't aware of how complicated it is to generate a suduko puzzle where it had 1 solution and could be solved without guessing. I had randomly assigned numbers to pre-filled cells thinking that would suffice and although puzzles are generated where the pre-filled cells follow the rules of suduko, the randomess means that the player would have to guess rather than being able to use what is given to fill in the cells. It was still interesting to come up with a way to randomize the board everytime and still have those cells follow suduko rules.
